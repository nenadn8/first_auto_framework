### This is my first test framework.

#### History

**Commit 7** (2024-12-06): Note: Maybe remove the default value for locator_type in SeDriver for simplicity and consistency. If done this way, also change LoginPage methods to reflect this change. 

**Commit 6** (2024-11-29): Fixed a bug where unittest didn't recognize there is 1 test in the suite. Test methods must start with "test_" which wasn't the case initially which caused the bug.
